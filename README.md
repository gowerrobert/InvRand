# InvRand
Inverse Random is a suite of randomized methods for inverting positive definite matrices implemented in MATLAB

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Introduction


This is a suite of randomized methods for inverting positive definite matrices implemented in MATLAB, based on methods described in

[1]	Robert M. Gower and Peter Richtarik,
    Randomized Quasi-Newton Updates are Linearly Convergent Matrix Inversion Algorithms, 
    arXiv:1602.01768

The methods implemented are

AdaRBFGS        (Adaptive Randomized Block BFGS)

MR              (Minimal Residual method with self-conditioning)

Newton-Schulz   (The Newton-Schulz method)              

# 2. Installation and Setup

Start Matlab and make sure that the working directory is set to the
main directory of the present package.  At the MATLAB prompt, run

  >> setup_InvRand

To test if the installation and setup have been 
completed successfully please run in the MATLAB prompt:

  >> demo_InvRand
  >> demo_LIBSVM
  >> demo_UF

# 3. Repeat tests in paper [1]

WARNING: The following experiments are CPU and data intensive!

To run the tests carried out in the paper [1] do the following.
To repeat all random matrix tests, at the MATLAB prompt run

  >> test_all_User() 

To repeat all the UF sparse matrix tests, at the MATLAB prompt run

  >> problems =  [1401, 440, 760, 40, 868, 937, 1288];
  >> test_all_UF(problems)                     % Tests a sequence of UF Matrices [3]

NOTE: this will download approx. a GB of data to your local hard drive!
To repeat all the LIBSVM tests, run the commands

  >> get_LIBSVM_data
  >> problems =  {'aloi', 'protein','gisette_scale', 'real-sim' }
  >> prefix = './tests/LIBSVM/data/';
  >> test_all_LIBSVM(problems,prefix)           % Tests a sequence of ridge regression matrices using data from LIBSVM [2]

NOTE: the script 'get_LIBSVM_data' will download a total of 380MB to your local hard drive.
